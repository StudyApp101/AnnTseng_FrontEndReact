<h1> Noteable | A Reading and Notetaking Application </h1>

Project Summary:
Noteable is a React application I created after coming together with a team of designers during the summer months to see how we can design an application that combines PDF reading, notetaking, and AI summarization functionalities.

Project Process + Solution:
I initially wanted to focus my summer project on specifically user-experience design, but at the end of the project I decided to see if I could implement my design case study into a functioning React application based off of my design work.

My case study of Noteable's UX design methodology and process: https://ann-c-tseng.github.io/assets/projectPages/noteableAssets/noteable.html

Development and Design Tools Used:
React JS, CSS, Figma
